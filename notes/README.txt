grbm and sbpl:  good fits, errors and stats.

copl:  doesn't fit high energy data.  BGO or LLE/LAT.  not a good fit.

grbm+lpow:  bad fit.  The PL is insignificant.  It eiter dives steep at low energies or dives steep at high energies.  no errors.

sbpl+lpow:  same as above.  bad fit.

copl+lpow:  doesn't match the data.

grbm+blackb:  great fit, errors and stats. no other place the bb could be.

sbpl+blackb:  same as above.  no other place the bb could be.

copl+blackb:  doesn't fit at high energies.

grbm+blackb+lpow:  Either the PL or the BB will be insignificant and resulting in the model without the 3rd component as above.  not good.

sbpl+blackb+lpow:  same as above.

copl+blackb+lpow:  not bad.  good fit, errors, stats.
